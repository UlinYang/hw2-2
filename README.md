# hw2-2

specification: PwmOut (D6); AnalogIn (A0); AnalogOut (D7);

How to setup: connect D6 and GND to the led light to form breathing light. Connect the AO of light sensor to A0 to recieve the light sensor signal, then connect D7 to picoscope to display the signal we recieve from light sensor on the picoscope.

Result: you should see a nonideal sine wave on the picoscope, when you approach the led with light sensor.
